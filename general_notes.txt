General ideas for presentation:
(this is very rough, and subject to constant iteration)

I.  What is Phoenix?
- General idea of Phoenix
- Phoenix can be most easily compared to Rails.  Presentation does not assume you are familiar with Rails, but some general comparisons of its place in the web development ecosystem are helpful.
- Features of Phoenix that Rails (and other existing frameworks) don't have
- Business use cases for Phoenix as a result of above

II. What is Elixir?
- Elixir is a Ruby-like language that runs on the Erlang machine.
- Which means what, exactly?
- This isn't an intro to Elixir course, but a look at it would be helpful because we'll be going through some Phoenix code later.
- We assume you can generally figure out the syntax;  we're just looking at specifics

III.  A sample Phoenix project
- solving an important business decision-making problem:  trilemmate local optimum
- it's already up.  Go to whatever.herokuapp.com
- this is how a Phoenix app is put together.  We'll walk through its structure, so you can see how its features are reflected in the application itself
- [optional, if time permits.  Add a new feature.  Something about a scoreboard?  Extension to user model?]
